This extension can automatically add or delete extensions depending on your preference.
It adds as many as you have loaded on the page(scroll for more) or deletes 100 connections at a time.
There are some bugs with "add connections", sometimes it tries to add people multiple times.

Step 1:
    Click green "Code" button, download ZIP and unzip the file.

Step 2:
    Go to chrome://extensions and turn on developer mode in the top right.

Step 3: 
    Click "Load Unpacked" in the top left and upload the extracted folder(not the zip). Enable the extension.

Step 4:
    To add connections, go to https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/grow/ and press the green button.
    To delete connections, go to https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/invite-connect/connections/ and press the red button.
